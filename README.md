# UART Transmitter and Receiver in Verilog HDL

## Description
This project implements a complete UART Transmitter and Receiver
using Verilog HDL. The design includes baud rate generation,
FSM-based framing logic, and testbench-driven verification using
Icarus Verilog.

## Features
- UART Transmitter (TX)
- UART Receiver (RX)
- Configurable baud rate
- Start/Stop bit framing
- Testbench verification
- GTKWave waveform analysis

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Icarus Verilog (iverilog)
- GTKWave
- VS Code

## Status
🚧 Under Development
